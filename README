This directory contains the source for the setup program for the cygwin
net releases.

For code guidelines, see GUIDELINES.

RELEASE BLOCKERS:
   Currently, none!

TODO:
 * Don't downgrade if the curr version is <= installed?
 * Support rpm/deb files for reading the package from. (To allow the
   maintainers the use of rpm/deb tools to create packages.)
 * Make a librar(y|ies) for setup and cygcheck to use containing 
   1) Something to translate POSIX -> native.  Currently called "cygpath"
      in setup, although this is probably a bad choice of name.
   2) Something to return the list of installed packages.
   3) Something to return the cygwin mount table.  Currently, I have implemented
      a lightweight setmntent and getmntent using the code in 
   4) Something to parse a tar file name into package/version or alternatively,
      return that information from 2)
   5) Something to return a list of files associated with a package.
 * Mark versions as prev/curr/test in the GUI when clicking through them.
 * Make setup.exe available through Add/Remove
 * Chooser scrollbar sometimes lost with odd font sizes.
 * Cancelling during MD5 check just stops the GUI updating until the check
   completes, and then continues with setup as if Cancel had not been clicked. 
 * Toggling from All Default to All Install takes *way* too long.
 * Remove installed packages from Misc when other (non-All) categories are
   found.
 * Local package scan stops updating when it stops being the active window.
 	   
WISHLIST:
 * Some way to download *all* the source.
 * When clicking on a category that is showing a partial list (auto added items
   due to dependencies) show the full list rather than minimizing.
 * Incremental/recoverable download capability.
 * Build-depends.
 * FTP control connections should be closed when we are awaiting user input.
 * Show a sdesc for each category.
 * Add friendly error reporting to simpsock.cc.
 * Scan newly installed files for README files, show list to user, let them
   read them if they want.
 * Mouse wheel support broken/missing for *some* users.
 * When in category view, and changing from prev->normal->exp the categories
   get collapsed. This is non-intuitive.
 * mirrors.lst to be copied to setup.ini and cached locally. Then the master
   mirrors list is reserved for bootstrapping.
 * Clicking on a package that is in multiple categories should update the view
   of the package in both locations on screen. - Done?
 * Remember the view mode - ie if you leave setup in partial, it returns to
   partial automatically.
 * Downloading from the internet should be _able_ to list based on what is
   present in the cache, as opposed to what is installed. (To help building a
   complete install set for a different machine).
 * New view - "action / category / package"
 * New view - show installed packages only. Probably not categorised.
 * Don't ask about the start menu or desktop options if they already exist.
 * Save the manual proxy settings so they don't need to be retyped.
 * Detect files in multiple packages.
 * Save all options.
 * Run a different script after finishing setup.
 * Show bin and src download size.
 * Confirm cancellation of setup if in the middle of doing something.
 * Improve mirror selection UI.
 * Ability to "hold" the version of a package - i.e. never auto-upgrade.

Unconfirmed Bugs

 * When installing and enough packages default to visible, the RH scrollbar is 
   sometimes hidden.
 * BSOD switching to install mode after downloading lots of software.
   
Recently Completed

 * View button is not clear at first view. (the dotted highlight).
 * Continue downloading past errors, present log of failures at end. (partial)
 * Multiple mirror support, with setup.ini from each merged automagically.
 * Installed packages aren't automatically upgraded.
 * Dependencies should not trigger alterations to user actions for installed
   packages that have any action other than uninstall.
 * Wide descriptions can get truncated - i.e. SSMTP.
 * SKIP and KEEP sometimes appearing for the same package.
 * Set the screen size for 640x480 users.
 * View mdoe caption on the right hand of the screen.
 * Downloading from the internet should allow redownloading already present
   files. (This happens via the reinstall/redo already - perhaps this is done.)
 * Make skip only ever appear for non-installed packages.
 * Skip sould be followed by the <prev/curr/exp> from the radio buttons,
   not by prev.
 * Src tickbox /source only can be confusing.
 * ini.cc: add field in setup.ini to specify whether package is installed by
   default, or not. (Base category does this)
 * Remove "/" from symlinks (etags.exe->/ctags.exe) is an example.
 * Src tickbox /source only can be confusing.
 * Handle UNC paths for the localdir correctly.
 * Chooser dialog needs work.
 * A command line option to prevent overwrite-on-reboot functionality.
 * Set ntsec permissions correctly, and for new installs enable ntsec.
 * Spurious "Cannot open (null) for reading" errors.
 * Sometimes packages set to 'Keep' appear in the 'Partial' view.
 * For local dir installs, Going back, changing the local cache dir, and going
   forward again does not
   correctly reparse inis in the new dir.
   Reproduction: Choose an incorrect cache dir, go back, correct it.
   Chooser shows all packages in Misc.
   - more details: packages get the correct categories assigned, but have misc
     added IF they where already installed.
     cycling the view adds the previously missing categories correctly.
 * "compress_bz::error called" appears in the log every time a package is
   installed, even if everything works.
 * New view - show non installed packages only.
 * Remove *empty* directories on uninstalls.
 * Correctly overwrite -r--r--r-- files.
 * Audit rfc1738 code for bad memory/string handling. Example: Crash occurs if
   rfc1738 encoded dirname is truncated in the middle of a %xx sequence.
   Crash not reproducible with test cases, and the code does not handle memory badly. 
 * Log postinstall scripts to a file.
