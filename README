This directory contains the source for the setup program for the cygwin
net releases.

For the time being Microsoft Visual Studio must be installed in order
for this to compile.  While there are some GNUish files in the source 
directory these are experimental.  The cinstall setup.exe does not yet
work when built with mingw.

If you have any problems the initial version of this program was
written by Ron Parker.  Currently, March 2000, he may be reached at
rdparker@butlermfg.com.
