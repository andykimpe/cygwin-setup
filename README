This directory contains the source for the setup program for the cygwin
net releases.

For the time being Microsoft Visual Studio must be installed in order
for this to compile.  The procedure is fairly normal, just type 'make'
in bash not 'nmake' from a "DOS" command prompt.  However, what the make
does is somewhat different.  It first creates some compressed files that
are placed into the resource segment of the setup program.  It then
calls 'msdev' to actually compile the setup.exe.

If you have any problem's the initial version of this program was
written by Ron Parker.  Currently, March 2000, he may be reached at
rdparker@butlermfg.com or rparker1@kc.rr.com.
