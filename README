This directory contains the source for the setup program for the cygwin
net releases.



To-Do list:

install.cc: read old .lst.gz file before overwriting it; remove any
files in the old install that aren't also in the new install.

add netio subclasses for direct HTTP, FTP and proxy connections

ini.cc: add field in setup.ini to specify whether package is installed
by default, or not.

install.cc: scan newly installed files for README files, show list to
user, let them read them if they want.

Add uninstall capability

Make the site listbox bigger.

download.cc: add a "total progress" indicator, like the install one.
