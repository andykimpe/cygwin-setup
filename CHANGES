Version 2.457.2.1

 - Fix setup keeping open handles to every tarball it installs during a run.
   (Which appears to have been indirectly responsible for the weird hangs
   people have been experiencing.)

 - Fix a miscellany of error-reporting deficiencies.

 - Close stdin, to protect against rogue postinstall scripts attempting to
   wait for user input.

Version 2.427

 - Last release before CHANGES file begun.
