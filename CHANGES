Version 2.5xx

 - Display only valid URL schemes in the mirrors list.

 - Remember proxy port setting.

 - Fix dependency calculation bug.

 - Enable support for XP themes.

 - Significant improvements to many pages.

 - Added explanations of various things, both in-dialog, and as tooltips.

 - Remove the --no-md5 (-5) command line option - the cache is now never 
   fully MD5-ed, as to do so takes far too long, and packages will be checked
   before installation anyway.

 - Make the MD5 checks immediately prior to installing packages actually
   display notification in the GUI.

 - Re-order actions, eliminating most if not all of the "cannot find DLL"
   errors whilst running preremove scripts.

 - Fix unpacking of hardlinks in source packages.

 - Huge overhaul of dependency handling.

 - Mouse wheel support in the package chooser.

Version 2.457.2.2

 - Set CYGWIN=nontsec, for postinstall scripts.

 - Fix corrupt display of ini parse percentage in log file.

 - Filter the mirrors list to only URL schemes that setup can use.

Version 2.457.2.1

 - Fix setup keeping open handles to every tarball it installs during a run.
   (Which appears to have been indirectly responsible for the weird hangs
   people have been experiencing.)

 - Fix a miscellany of error-reporting deficiencies.

 - Close stdin, to protect against rogue postinstall scripts attempting to
   wait for user input.

Version 2.427

 - Last release before CHANGES file begun.
